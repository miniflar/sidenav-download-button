### Support
This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community. I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://ralkage.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the [Flarum community discussion](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/27059).
